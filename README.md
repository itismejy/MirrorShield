# 🛡️ Mirror Shield – TECHIN510 Interactive Simulation Project

## Project Objective:
Develop an interactive simulation tool to help users recognize, understand, and respond to manipulative behaviors often associated with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), such as gaslighting, love bombing, and blame-shifting. The tool will educate users through realistic dialogue paths and reflection mechanisms, fostering emotional resilience and awareness.

Goals:
1. Front-end UI implementation for a website
2. Integration with LLM technology to generate NPD dialogue

Constraints:
1. Must be delivered within the 10 week ccontract
2. Final product must be bug free and accessible by client
   
## Target users:
- Individuals recovering from toxic relationships or emotionally manipulative dynamics
- People vulnerable to manipulation (empaths, highly sensitive individuals, caregivers)
- Supporters or friends of those affected with NPD

## Must Have Features:
- Branching scenario simulator with AI/NPD-patterned dialogue
- Real-time red flag radar that highlights manipulation tactics

## Nice to Have Features:
- Toolkit with therapist-informed scripts for boundary setting
- Emotional energy meter to visualize the toll of interactions



## Features nice-to-have:
- Reflection journaling component
- Weekly insights or progress summary
- Unlockable tips/educational content based on engagement
- Sound/visual cues for emotional tone
